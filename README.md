# TAROT
## Overview
This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of **TAROT**, the algorithm proposed in the paper:
<br>
["TAROT: Towards Essentially Domain-Invariant Robustness
with Theoretical Justification"](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2025/papers/Yang_TAROT_Towards_Essentially_Domain-Invariant_Robustness_with_Theoretical_Justification_CVPR_2025_paper.pdf)
<br>
by *Dongyoon Yang, Jihu Lee, and Yongdai Kim.*

The paper was published in CVPR 2025. 

## Quickstart
